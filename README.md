# Pencil

Pencil is a simple service-registration tool for Docker and uses Consul as a backend for
Service-Discovery. It syncronizes only the delta `âˆ†` between the local state on every node
(Running Docker Containers) and the remote state on Consul registry every (n) seconds.
The default is set to `10s`.

Pencil have been used in many different production systems and successfully synchronized hundreds of
thouthands of contianers without problems.

## Run Pencil from DockerHub image:
```
docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock alaa/pencil:2 <consul-registry-address>
```

Or build the docker image yourself:

## Building and Running Pencil:

Build the Docker image
```
docker build -t pencil .
```

Run it
```
docker run -d \
           -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock \
           pencil <consul-registry-address>
```

we need to mount the docker-engine socket into Pencil container in order to give it a privilige to
observe the contaners state on the host.

## SERVICE_ lable as a convention:

### Consul Tags:
You can pass array of strings to [Consul Tags](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http/agent.html#agent_service_register) using container environment variables.

- All tags should start with `SERVICE_`
- All tags keys should be passed as upper case letters as `SERVICE_TAG` not `SERVICE_tag`

- Tag keys should match the following regex: `/^SERVICE_[A-Z0-9-_]+[A-Z0-9]$/`
- Tag keys should be greater than `5 chars` and less than `40 chars`

- Tag values should match the following regex: `/^[a-z0-9-_]+[a-z0-9]$/`
- Tag values should be greater than `3 chars` and less than `200 chars`

For example:  `docker run -P -e "SERVICE_CLUSTER=staging_01" nginx`

### Consul Service Name:
By default Pencil registers every docker contianer that exposes a `TCP Port`. and uses the
following convention for registering services on consul: `<docker-image-name>-<exposed-container-port>`.

For example: `docker run -P nginx` will let Pencil to register this container under the following name:
`nginx-80` as nginx image exposes TCP port `80`

If you wish to register your service as an alternative name, you can pass `SERVICE_NAME` to the container
and Pencil will use that string as the `preferred name` for consul registration.

For example: `docker run -P -e 'SERVICE_NAME=testing-microservice' nginx`

### Consul Health Check:
You can pass custom health check to Consul via docker container environment variables.
Pencil fills out the `host` and `port` dynamically on the run time. For example:

##### HTTP HealthCheck example:
`docker run -P nginx -e "SERVICE_HEALTH_CHECK='curl -Ss http://%<host>s:%<port>s/health'"`

##### TCP HealthCheck example:
`docker run -P nginx -e "SERVICE_HEALTH_CHECK='nc -vz %<host>s %<port>s'"`

Pencil replaces the `host` with the value of `<consul-registry-address>` passed to the `agent`
and replaces the `port` dynamically by inspecting `container.PortMapping`

## TODO
- Refactoring
- Write tests
